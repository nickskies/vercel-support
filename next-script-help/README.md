# Issue Documentation 00045007

Outcome desired
- when loading pages/fire.js
-   1. jquery should be loaded 
-   2. the dom should read "cats"

Steps to reproduce issue.
- pages/index.js has next/link to load pages/fire.js
- error pops up that $ is not defined

Questions
- how do i acheive this with next/script
- It seems no matter what strategy i use, the outcome desired does not work.
